# dog-race
Project from an interview I did in October 2017. I was giving the following instructions:

We're running dog trials, and in these trials there are 3 teams of 3 dogs, and each dog runs 3 times. 
What I'm looking for is a small php program where I can input an individual dog's score per round and 
have that score assigned to the dog for that round, updating the team's cumulative score per round each time. 
The values should be saved to a msyql database.  

Please provide any HTML/CSS/JS/PHP required, as well as database structure. There is no one right way to do this 
exercise, it's intention is to give me a glimpse of your manner of thinking.
